## **About Our Website** <span id="about"></span>

This is an anime website that features animes based on your search. Also, it provides you with GIFs that are related to the anime you like. 

While the client-side programming and design of our website are top-notch, the server-side programming is on another level. By using express, we have managed to cut down our code and also improve our fetching process by using promises. 

We have also managed to hide our API key through .env npm package.

This made our project stand out in the backend programming it has.


## **User Journey** :books: <span id="stories"></span>

The user enters the website to find a landing page with an anime theme. Then, as the user scrolls down, he can search for an anime he likes. 

Afterwards, an anime list will show up with a 'View GIFs' button that appears when hovering on the specific anime card. When clicking, the user gets redirect to our GIFs page that shows anime pictures related to the anime.
